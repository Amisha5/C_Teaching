Token :: Smallest unit of C program..

few types of Tokens are::
1.Identifier
2.Variable
3.Constant
4.Keywords
5.Operators

1.Identifier :: 

2 Variable :: it is storage unit.
	It is used to store data and value can be changed.

syntax:: type variable_list;  
example:: int num; float fl;

rules for defining variable::
@ A variable can have alphabets, digits, and underscore.
@ A variable name can start with the alphabet, and underscore only. It can't start with a digit.
@ No whitespace is allowed within the variable name.
	example:: int num vlaue // invalid 
		  int numvalue // valid
@ A variable name must not be any keyword, e.g. int, float, etc.

types of variable::
#.local variable::that is declared inside the block.
	example:: void main()
		 {
		   int num=10; //local variable
		 }

#.GLobal Variable::that is declared outside the function or block.
	example:: int number=30; //global variable
		 void main()
		 {
		   int num=10; //local variable
		 }

3.Constant ::t is storage unit.
	It is used to store data and value can not be changed.
	to declare constant we use "const" keyword..
example:: const int num=10; // further num value cant be changed because it is constant.

4.Keywords:: are reserved words.whose functionality is fixed. there are 32 keywords in C language.
	void, int , char , double , float, const, short, long,
	signed, unsigned, if, else , do, for, while, switch,auto
	case, default, break , continue, goto, return, volatile,
 	extern, static, register, enum, struct,union, typedef, sizeof

5.Operatores:: It is simply a symbol that is used to perform operations. There can be many types of operations like arithmetic, logical, bitwise, etc.
